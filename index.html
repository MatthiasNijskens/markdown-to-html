<h4>A funny story</h4>
<i>So there was one time, me and a friend went to this girl's birthday party. We took the train there and she picked us up at the station. There were like 8 of us and we were chilling in her parents room (they were on holiday) while her older sister was downstairs with her boyfriend. Suddenly another girl wanted to open a window because it was getting hot but somehow when opening the window she managed to break the glass door of a closet. The floor was full of glass shards. The older sister heard it, ran up the stairs to check out what happened. Once she saw the glass shards on the floor and the broken closet she went completely mad and sent us all out of the house. The thing is, we were all going to spend the night there and it was already midnight so we couldn't take a train home anymore. So there we were, in the middle of nowhere, no place to stay or sleep. The girl (whose birthday it was) said she had a tent somewhere and we decided to find a grass field not too far from her house to set it up. We ended up sleeping in a 2 man tent with 8 people. I honestly dont know how we managed to fit in there. The next morning we woke up, found a bakery and bought some pastries. After that we just waited on a train to get back home. All in all i had a really good time though.</i>
<h5>TL;DR</h5>
